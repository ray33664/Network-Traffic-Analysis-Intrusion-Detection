# Network Traffic Analysis & Intrusion Detection

## Objective
To capture and analyze network traffic and detect suspicious activities
using Wireshark and Snort on Kali Linux.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- Snort 3
- Nmap

## Methodology
1. Captured normal network traffic using Wireshark
2. Analyzed packets using protocol filters
3. Ran Snort in packet and alert mode
4. Simulated attacks using Nmap on localhost
5. Observed packet flow and IDS alerts

## Key Findings
- Normal traffic showed balanced TCP, DNS, and ICMP packets
- Port scanning generated abnormal packet patterns
- Snort successfully detected suspicious traffic

## Disclaimer
All experiments were conducted in a controlled and legal environment
using localhost and owned systems only.
