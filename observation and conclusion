🔍 Observations

Network traffic was successfully captured in real time using Wireshark on the active network interface.

Normal traffic consisted mainly of TCP, DNS, and ICMP packets with balanced packet flow.

Packet analysis showed clear source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, and packet lengths.

During simulated scans using Nmap on localhost, a significant increase in TCP SYN packets was observed.

Snort 3 was able to capture live network packets after enabling packet dump and alert modes.

Abnormal traffic patterns such as repeated connection attempts were identified during intrusion simulation.

No alerts were generated during normal traffic capture, indicating correct baseline behavior.

All analysis was performed in a controlled and legal environment.

✅ Conclusion

The Network Traffic Analysis & Intrusion Detection project successfully demonstrated how network traffic can be monitored and analyzed using Wireshark and Snort 3 on Kali Linux. By capturing normal traffic and simulating intrusion activities in a controlled environment, the project highlighted the differences between legitimate and malicious network behavior. Snort proved effective in monitoring network activity and detecting suspicious patterns, while Wireshark provided detailed packet-level insights. This project enhanced practical understanding of intrusion detection systems and network security monitoring, making it valuable for real-world cybersecurity applications and Security Operations Center (SOC) roles.
